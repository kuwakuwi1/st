## Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
in Ubuntu, it's already shipped by default, but just to make sure, run:
```
sudo apt install libx11-dev
```

## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

```bash
sudo make clean install
```

## Running st

Run `st` from terminal or search st from start menu.

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```bash
tic -sx st.info
```

See the man page for additional details.

### Keyboard Shortcut
Action      | Key Combination
---         | ---
Copy        | `ctrl` + `shift` + `c`
Paste       | `ctrl` + `shift` + `v`
Zoom In     | `ctrl` + `shift` + `PageUp`
Zoom Out    | `ctrl` + `shift` + `PageDown`
Reset Zoom  | `ctrl` + `shift` + `Home`

### Colorscheme patch
The colorscheme patch is a custom patch, it is not the ones from [colorscheme](https://st.suckless.org/patches/colorschemes/)
It is `solarized.dark` exported from https://terminal.sexy with a different bg and fg color.
Also the `defaultfg`, `defaultbg` and `defaultcs` are not `static`s, otherwise it won't compile.

### Previous available patches

* [Fix Keyboard Input](https://st.suckless.org/patches/fix_keyboard_input/) : Add a few previously undefined keys.
Removed as this was used for additional keys for zooming.

## Modification
If you want to edit the config, then edit the config.mk or config.def.h (not the config.h, because it's automatically generated when compiling (make install command)
